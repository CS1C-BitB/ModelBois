# ModelBois
CS1C Group Project

## Getting Started

Run the following command to make a copy of this repository on your computer:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:ChrisJAllan/ModelBois.git
```

Before making changes, first make a branch for the feature you will be working on. 
Do not make any commits to the master branch.
Always base the branches off of the latest upstream master. 
The branch names will be your name and a short description of the feature, eg. `chris-ShapeClasses`.

To update the master branch on your local copy, run the following commands:
```
git checkout master
git pull
```
Then, to make and switch to your feature branch:
```
git branch -b name-FeatureName
```

Then, open the `ModelBois.pro` file in QtCreator to begin editing. 
After you have completed a task, commit your work with a useful message.
This can be done from the command line or from within QtCreator itself.
After you have completed the feature, push your branch to Github with
```
git push -u origin branchName
```
and go to the project's Github page to open a pull request for it to be added to master.
